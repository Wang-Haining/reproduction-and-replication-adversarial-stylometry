	At times, religion is hypocritical. Christianity tells us that pride is a sin, but it's pride that makes people do irrational things when it comes to religion. That's the reason all these wars were fought. Most churches are supposed to represent purity when its own hierarchy is corrupt. I expressed earlier the fact that priests have committed some of the same sins as we have. I don't hold must truth to vows. Vows are merely words, and words are merely sounds. Whether they follow their own words or not depends on teh nature of the person. The fact that an institution would even exist when man's relationship with his god is supposed to be his own business is hypocritical. 
	Some people will disagree by saying that religion gives people a hope, something to believe in. For example, religion has brought many people out of the gutter. Many drug addicts, criminals, and rock stars whose belief has been strong turned them back into productive members of society. Also, people will argue that churches have the First Amendment's right to go out and recruit for their religion. They say as long as it can be legally done, they have the right. Last, they say to push anything on religious practices violates the same rights I've been talking about. To each his own.
	Religion is possibly the most destructive tool we have on this planet. People that feel the need to belong will do almost anything for it. Much of the population, if nothing else, needs to educate themselves as it relates to the ideas above. Just because something is legal doesn't make it right. I'm not trying to impress this belief on others. I don't care if others agree with me. In fact, I don't want them to agree with me. It's more fun that way, anyway.
