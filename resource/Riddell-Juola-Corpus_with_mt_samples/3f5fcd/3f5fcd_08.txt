    Some people may argue that putting a weapon in the pilot's hands is stupid, due to the fact that the pilots could make irrational decisions and possibly not be trained. I think that this argument is weak. The pilots would have required training and refresher sessions to teach them how to use a weapon safely, and mental training to help them through the situations. This sessions would not be limited to, but include special weapons and counter terrorism training. Also, having only one bullet in the gun would allow for decreased damage possibly dealt. Arguing that it’s dangerous to arm pilots with a weapon is a bad argument because the pilots run the plane and they don't need a gun to destroy everyone on the plane, and being a pilot requires extensive background checks, and screening in most cases. There is no additional risk to the passengers’ safety by equipping the pilots. In fact, the plane becomes a safer place to be.
    Another argument people may make is that it might make the pilots mentally unstable.
This is no more a concern than it is with members of law enforcement. If a pilot does have an instance where he or she has to shoot someone, they may experience emotional distress or repercussions after the fact. However, before the incident occurs  I do not believe it would affect their mental state. 
If for any reason the pilot is not able to pull the trigger and the weapon ends up in the hands of a terrorist, it’s virtually the same situation as if the  terrorist were taking over the plane of an unarmed pilot - the same as it would be now.
    Overall, there are many benefits to arming pilots, with little to no risks involved. Arming pilots would not only make planes a safer place, but would ensure the entire skies become a safer environment. Arming pilots on commercial  and other airlines is a good, safe idea.
