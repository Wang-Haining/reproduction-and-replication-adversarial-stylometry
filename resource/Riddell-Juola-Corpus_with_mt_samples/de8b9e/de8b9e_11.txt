She then proceeds to show him into the house, and puts on a display of coincidentally stumbling upon Lady Audley’s forgotten key to her jewelry box. Overcome with greed at the sight of the riches, Luke suggests stealing a diamond, but Phoebe’s cunning shows as she discovers baby hairs in a secret drawer and proclaiming “you shall have the public house, Luke”. This foreboding vow is indicative of her scheme to extort money from Lucy. It is not so far-fetched that she had led her future husband into the house so as to implant the thought of robbery in his mind, putting no burden on her if he were to be caught. From there it is not difficult to infer that she knew from the start where the key was, and it was by no accident that she was to show her mistress’ jewelry. However, upon finding the secret baby articles she got it into her mind that she could profit much more in the long term through extortion. It is doubtful she knew what her Lady’s secret was exactly, but sensing trouble, she decided to let it unfold and then jump at the opportunity to make herself better off. 
	Phoebe’s chance comes along when she witnesses Lucy push her previous husband George Tallboys down a well. Phoebe even learns that Luke had helped George out of the well, quite alive, but does not bother to reveal this to her mistress, who lives on believing she committed murder. Phoebe then plays the helpless victim as she tells Lucy of Luke’s abusive and violent tendencies. 

Painting herself as an innocent victim at the mercy of her husband, Phoebe is able to keep herself in the confidence of Lady Audley while continuously exploiting her fear of exposure. This is rather representative of her character; she is eager to throw anyone else in the line of harm or blame, as long as it is benefits her in the end.
