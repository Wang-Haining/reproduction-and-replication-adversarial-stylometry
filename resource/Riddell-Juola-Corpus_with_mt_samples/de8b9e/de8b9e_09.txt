	Nuclear waste reprocessing seems to be a viable solution for the problems of increasing energy demands and the waste and pollutants created in attempting to meet them. It seems rather wasteful to disregard this massive amount of energy that can be harnessed from the naturally occurring nuclear fuel. It is even more wasteful to only extract such a meager amount of energy as is currently done through light water reactors. The fact that such reprocessing methods as molten salt reactors are capable of generating as much as 75 times more energy than conventional reactors cannot be ignored when considering the benefits of implementing such a technology. 
	While, there will be an influx of plutonium transportation and storage due to this, there is no evidence that indicates it would increase the risk of malicious theft and weapon production. These risks are already curbed by the Nuclear Repository Committee, which regulates the transportation and storage of radioactive material, and would accommodate a growing number of these new reactors. 
	Furthermore, the amount of unused nuclear waste and its disposal in the United States is concerning. Not only does it seem archaic to simply bury the radioactive material that is produced from or has come in contact with military or civil nuclear reactions, but it comes with its own risks. Accidents and improper storage could result in such disasters as the one in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico in 2014. If less actinide waste is made to be disposed of, as is the case after running molten salt reactors, then the risk for such failures would be significantly less. 
	Overall, the estimates for this new technology appear very promising, but further testing and data is needed to better estimate its effects.
