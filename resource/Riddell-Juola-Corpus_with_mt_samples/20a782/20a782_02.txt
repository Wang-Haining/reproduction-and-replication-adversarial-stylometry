Finally, people who commit a crime still need to be productive members of society. In the United States, like many other Western countries, citizens are required to pay income taxes, provide for themselves or their families, purchase food, maintain a place to live and have employment. Without the ability to be able to benefit from his or her own labor, this disadvantages the individual severely. How would a person who was committed a crime and been incarcerated, be able to pay for hospital bills, rent or other amenities if they are not able to use the money earned from their work? In extreme cases, a combination of all these factors including the inability to pay for necessities, food and housing has led some to become so disenfranchised with their lives that they have given up on pursuing a life of purpose and succumbed to homeless. In Los Angeles, there is an infamous area christened Skid Row, where the homeless tend to congregate and sleep in ramshackle tents on the sidewalks. The homelessness problem there has been exacerbated by the toll of crime and the effect it has had on their lives where they are left at the fringes of society. While this is not the case for everyone who as committed a crime, and of course it depends on the severity of the crime, it is a very real problem for those who are not allowed to benefit from their hard labor and left at the fringes of society. 
In conclusion, it is clear that not all crimes are the same, and as such, the individual that commits them should be published accordingly. Further, loss of rights depends on the crime and are not striped indefinitely unless it is decreed by the law. Additionally, every individual as the right to be able to benefit from their labor, and thus to take care of themselves and their families. Consequently, every crime a person commits should be taken in a case-by-case basis and evaluated accordingly.
