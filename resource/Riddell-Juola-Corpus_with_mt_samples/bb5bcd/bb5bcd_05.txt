	Charles Handy hints at the idea that we Americans may feel that capitalism is giving an answer to a question that lies deep within us. He notes that it is a belief in Africa that there are two hungers. The lesser hunger is for food and other necessities of life, whereas the greater hunger is for an answer to the ultimate question. Handy implies in the first pages of his book The Hungry Spirit that modern capitalism is capable of filling the lesser hunger so completely that we have appeased the greater hunger. 
In modern capitalist America, the dream is still to control one’s own destiny, but now the adversary isn’t the Great Depression after the First World War, or even the ruthless king that our country’s founders fled. The fight is against corporations that are using the labor of others to further themselves and their shareholders. Now Americans have the need to fight alongside foreign workers for their own rights and dreams. Hard work and responsibility are no longer helping families and individuals achieve their goals, and the American Dream is slowly turning into a simple desire for wealth, not the sense of accomplishment associated with it.
Luckily there is a small amount of hope that remains. These workers, even some internationally, have one tool that the corporations haven’t yet taken. There is a tool that perhaps is at the essence of the American Dream. It is the ability to control one’s destiny through democracy. It may be that Immortal Technique, a Hispanic American rapper born on a Peruvian military base has put it best in his song “Leaving the Past.” He states simply and earnestly “capitalism and democracy are not synonymous”.
