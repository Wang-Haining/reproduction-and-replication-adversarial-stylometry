In conclusion, Derrida  meticulously analyzes traditional beliefs and ponders the relationship between text and meaning. Through his theory of deconstruction and strong interest in language, he dismantles presupposed edifices to show that meaning is actually indeterminate.  His philosophy allows for evaluation of the structural unity of academic institutions through a proposition which describes the relationship between assumptions of the state and discourse of the academy. He also suggests fluidity of femininity in terms of the dance and its struggle in a male-dominated patriarchy. All in all, we have found that 12 pages is indeed insufficient to cover Derrida’s interesting philosophy of postmodern thought.
