The costs for this program are calculated on the size and types of mass-transit systems the state of NH decides it desires, the labor behind the systems (design, implementation, regulation, driving), maintenance and upkeep. These costs can vary from very little (making a few cars available during periods of the day for public transportation) to very high (rail systems, mixed with buses, taxis, airports, and, with Elon Musk’s vision, spaceports). The financing as I’ve said will ideally be done from private companies ambitious to make mass transit expanded in NH, and if that is challenging, the thought of mixed funding or pure public funding will have to be considered. Amtrak has stops in NH,  making them a great resource to consider for an expanded rail system. Concord Coach Lines already makes stops in northern NH, a consideration of expanding their services (frequency, more stops, more buses) would be in order. Taxi companies have started up in regions in NH, for example, in Conway we have Turtle Taxi and Fast Taxi (not a joke, the Turtle Taxi can still win a race), these types of companies are still popular, but with the advent of Uber, their necessity is questionable. 
With all of this in mind, I implore you to consider the idea of expanding mass transit in the state of NH within the next ten years. Increased population growth, economic growth, job security and increased connectivity can only come from an increase in mass transit. People in poverty will have access to other parts of the state and further than they had before with more mass transit, making it much easier to get around. The amount of pollution from personal vehicles will decrease, improving our vision of a sustainable future. Of course, we cannot forget that mass transit may not the path we chose in the past, but it certainly is the right step ahead for the future.
