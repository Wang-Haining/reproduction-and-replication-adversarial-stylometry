Acting and character development was pretty good in Frankenstein. Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein was the biggest driver of the story. He’s the best combination of intellect and crazy. His mannerisms, intensity and emotion he conveys throughout the film are spot on. Mae Clarke as Elizabeth is the pure emotion of the film. She provided a constant emotional tie to keep Frankenstein human at times. Clark acted well, be she, alongside just about everyone else, was just a limited role to Clive and Boris Karloff. Finally, Boris Karloff as Frankenstein’s monster shined. Playing a horrific monster under a mask, Karloff showed the most emotion of anyone in the film. You have him learning about life again, being afraid of fire and killing a man over it. But later you have a more caring and fun loving monster that was playing with a girl…before killing her. He had the perfect portrayal of something just looking to find who his is and why he was in this world. 
The purpose of Frankenstein has got to be to not mess with the natural order of the world. I would also say that it would be to be more understanding of everyone in general. If you mess with the natural order of things, things are bound to awry. Creating this monster is a bad thing. It went berserk and mauled a bunch of people, bad. But on the flipside, had the people tried to help, instead of fearing him, they might have coexisted better. If Frankenstein had treated him better, he might not have gone crazy like he did. We should treat everyone with the same amount of respect, that way, we don’t have as many messed up people running around.
