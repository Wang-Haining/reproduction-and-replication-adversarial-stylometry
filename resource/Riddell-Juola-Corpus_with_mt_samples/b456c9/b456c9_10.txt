	Where is the common ground between transgender and drag identities? Ultimately, in the spirit of the complex and subdivided nature of drag and transgender, one cannot be named. Instead, drag and transgender are connected by an open field of possibility, forming the basis for survival and community as well as revolution and rebellion. Lines between the two drawn on the basis of authenticity have been problematized by the literature of queer theory due to problems inherent in realizing gender as a force outside of its people and as an object not produced by discourses and forces of power, as put by Butler. Movements to separate drag and transgender on the basis of deployment, arguing drag is a product of parody and is only deployed for comedy or subversion, or arguing that transgender identities function only for the sake of survival, without the possibility of opposition or rebellion, have faced similar issues. Within context of each other, ‘drag’ and ‘transgender’ leave a critical ambiguity; as political projects they have articulated similar goals, as identities, they have been adopted by similar populations; and as spaces of resistance, they have worked in opposition to similar discourses and fonts of power. Hence, due to the dissolution of their referent population into a unified whole, ‘drag’ and ‘transgender’ have lost semantic distance and become, in their mutual context, inarticulate.
