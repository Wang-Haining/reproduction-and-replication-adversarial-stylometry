The typical chain tire place was, more business friendly than personable. Most important, they put the tire on the rim within a few moments and with one quick trip to the restroom, they were on their way back. Grandpa, to assure her car’s safety, had left his business partner with her car.  I asked, “How much am I going to owe you? He gave her, to her surprise, a price way under $100. He wanted to know who had recommended them. She googled them and gave him the name of the place. George/grandpa, stated, “I always try to give business back to people who recommend me.”
Not one hour and 40 minutes since the tire sensor had given the first warning DING, Karen was ready to be on her way. She shook both their hands. George, headed for another call, while his step son, waited behind her, to blink his lights, to alert her when it was safe to pull into the busy Friday afternoon highspeed traffic. Fog and a downpour made visibility poor. Finally, he blinked and off they went. Driving down the road, she smiled as she clenched “Grandpa’s” business card in her hand. 

NOW THAT, was good ol’ fashioned hospitality, she thought, as she called her daughter.

Connectedness.
 Do things happen for a reason? 
What If Karen had NOT accidentally pulled into the wrong” gas station on Front street, a few weeks prior? Perhaps this story would have a different ending.  
The next time you take a wrong turn and end up at the wrong place, don’t get exasperated or mad, embrace it. 
The good people we stumble upon on this journey called life, may amaze you. 
Try and leave yourself open to all the universe has to offer.
