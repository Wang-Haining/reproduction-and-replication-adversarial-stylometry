In conclusion there is not a single investor that trades like the other, and the opportunities one sees are mostly based off the level of risk that a person is willing to take in order to have a desired profit on the investment. As a result, investing behaviors have been narrowed down based on different levels of risk to classify individuals on the type of investment they personally prefer which often depends on the length of a specific trade and what type of movement is it based on the given volatility. This narrows it down to investors who seek to either invest in a conservative or aggressive manner which fit under the main categories; unless they trade for income, and that requires passive research by an individual or an advisor in order to meet the desired rates within a specific period of time. These instruments can be used to detect current standings based on the level of risk an individual likes to take, so they also do have the capacity to provide important insights that can be critical when making a finalized decision.
