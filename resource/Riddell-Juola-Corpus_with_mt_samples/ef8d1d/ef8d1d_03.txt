	When it comes to assessing the pros and cons of such energy, it is important to keep in mind that this process can undergo a magnitude of different conversion factors to fit the needs of the user. This often includes a wide range of final products that are purified into biogas and alcoholic forms whom are very different from the finalized product of other treatments such as the creation of syngas and other oily, gaseous, or even charcoal products. With each factor in mind, the range of useability extends greatly between different uses however one of the first things that come to mind when it comes to biomass energy is the initial product which is often referred to as the feedstock that includes algae, bioenergy crops, waste, and other residues which usually take a longer period of time and care to grow. This creates the environmental and mechanical aspects to become the foremost element in the conversion of biomass which have to potential to become insufficient resulting the blockage of expanding the role of this renewable resource in the alternative energy market. Ultimately, the limitations for this source often are expressed to provide about 5% of the total primary energy use in the United States for the year 2017. However considering that there are highly competitive feedstock growth such as algae grown in treated undrinkable water, the margin rate of biofuels gives it the most advantage for their relatively low cost in comparison to fossil fuels. Another advantage to this source material is that unlike conventional fuel can be found in the renewability and scarcity aspects of these fuels; there is no way to ever run out of something like ethanol in comparison to something such as coal or crude oil and that can also boost the value of organic commodities throughout the energy sector for future developmental uses. As a result, these biomass fuels can directly be turned into useable assets for farmers and even oil companies to combine with traditional oil for a cleaner overall combustion in main sectors such as agriculture and even  transportation.
