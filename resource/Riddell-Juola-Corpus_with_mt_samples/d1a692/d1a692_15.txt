	The fact that more individuals are taking to the Internet for their information seeking needs and are therefore finding online information communities such as the Titusville, FL information page should be taken as a positive sign that information needs are being met. After all, if those users were not finding information online, then they would not come back to that medium for new answers. Looking at the Titusville, FL community specifically, there is much proof that there are information needs being met. It is rare that a post never has discussion unless it is one that does not necessarily warrant for such. For instance, Jennifer Muller shared a post informing breastfeeding women that they could donate their breastmilk to held premature babies. This voluntarily-shared information is good for such women to know but does not necessarily facilitate for others to comment. For the majority of posts, however, information needs are being met on a regular basis. 
	To better assist such virtual information communities, a few resources and changes should be made. The Titusville, FL community is currently a closed group and therefore limits itself on its information sharing potential. In order to maximize the effect of an information group, it should be a public group in which anyone can see whom is a member and all of the posts that are being made. Additionally, a partnership or hybrid between such virtual communities and local services such as the library would do much to better the quality of information being shared across all information communities.
