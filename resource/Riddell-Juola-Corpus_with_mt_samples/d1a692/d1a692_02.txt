The other main challenge to information service for Indigenous communities is the location of the space. Many communities have established libraries or cultural centers within their immediate location but such projects require funding. Public libraries may be in proximity to the community but may not provide adequate services in respect to the Indigenous culture. Such public libraries also allow access to all patrons to view material—but perhaps a particular community wants only their own members as patrons. Additionally, as Burns, Doyle, Joseph, & Krebs argue, “even for Indigenous people who do ‘technically’ live inside a library services catchment area, there continue to be many visible and invisible barriers presented through library practices, collections, and services”. The issue of location could partially be solved by the number of grants that are available for establishing tribal libraries and centers, though that is but one aspect for solving such a challenge. 

My views on librarianship have changed. For the most part, I have believed that librarianship is mostly a means for providing a cultural education of sorts to its patrons. Whether a patron is reading a fiction book, referencing a fact in a nonfiction book, or utilizing library computers, those patrons are becoming immersed in a greater culture—of which, the library holds the key. Now I can see that it is not just the responsibility of librarians to present a culture and to educate their patrons on it, it is also their responsibility to assist in the preservation of culture in its original forms and intentions—and as in accordance with those within the culture.
