	For reading comprehension, I followed the state standard of students needing to “read, understand, and respond to essential content of text in all academic areas”. In this case, I think my lesson meets this standard because the anchor of this text is a grade-appropriate chapter book that is an informational text about a social studies topic. At the national level, the common core states that students at this grade level will be expected to “read and comprehend informational texts, including history/social studies tests. Understanding the text is essential for success during this lesson, and there will be many prompts and questions that will assess their comprehension. Accordingly, I think my lesson meets this standard about reading comprehension in other academic areas.
