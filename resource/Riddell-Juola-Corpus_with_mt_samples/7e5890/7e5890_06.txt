The various elements of this powerful moment are magnified in the sculpture because of both their sheer size and because of the way bright colors stand out from the rest of the statue, which is close to uniform set of colors. The medals call immediate attention to the competitive accomplishments of these men, but John Carlos’ beads, for the lives lost to racial injustice, are bright and stick out from his figure too. They bring further attention to the unzipped jacket, which is a nod of solidarity with blue collar workers. Both also sport silver badges, which are for human rights. The shoes sit beside them on their pedestals, which prompts a viewer to notice they’re only wearing black socks, a symbol for poverty experienced by African Americans, matching the pair of black gloves shared between them and raised as a symbol for black power.  The second place spot remains notably bare. While the Australian silver medalist supported his fellow competitors, even wearing the same human rights badge, he insisted that his spot on the sculpture remain empty so that a viewer could go and stand alongside. Even the statue’s location at San Jose State University honors Smith and Carlos having been students at the school.  
This piece is powerful and interesting on every level, and while it’s impossible to miss, everyone should take a closer look to appreciate its details and be aware of its history. The courage of this protest remains relevant today a full 50 years later as athletes like Colin Kaepernick use their national spotlight to continue to protest ongoing racial injustices.
