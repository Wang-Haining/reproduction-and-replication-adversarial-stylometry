Disney teaches us that racism can be moved into or shown into animation while being subtle about it. Moving to Aladdin, with the “it's barbaric, but hey, it's home” lyrics, this had given slander to many arabs, with a line of questioning as to why Disney believed they could get away with that in the first place. In Mulan, the tradition was always to base it patriachial society, while females were not treated as true equals in that nation. 
It seems to be based mainly on the fact that males are the superior being to females and for females to follow their heart.
Disney employs orientalism such that it may be defining a characteristic for people of a certain culture
If we look into Mulan, she does change it up a bit by cross-gender dressing as a male in order to take her Father's place in the military. Later on in the film, we find her 3 male friends cross-dressing themselves, yet the captain chooses not to do so. There's also timon and pumbaa being with each other with a friendship similar to Eric and Grimsby. In the little mermaid, we have ursula, who is role modeled based on a drag queen, but then, even her evil ways are portrayed in an odd fashion compared to disney's tradition, as the villians are usually angular and skinny, and obese usually is seen to be funny in disney films. 
In Mulan, at the end of the film, when Shan Yu was fighting against Shang, and Mulan had shown herself to be Ping, “the soldier from the mountain,” Shan Yu did not discriminate when he was fighting her, nor did he ever really in the film. He acknowledged her as an equal, despite he wanted to kill her, but when compared to how females were treated in the film, this should be counted as a positive outlook (the equality, not wanting to kill, that was bad).
