Even at the lowest point of Tobias’ struggles, these memories cling to him until he snaps back into it and is reminded that he is human first and foremost. Even with the limitation of being a hawk, Tobias has memories, mental images, to ascribe to. Even if Tobias may never be human again, as someone with gender dysphoria may never feel fully as their ideal biological gender, both have things they can ascribe themselves to accordingly, whether it be ideals, mental images, or anything else, it’s clear that for Tobias specifically, he can find much respite in his memories as they are what spur him back towards humanity, it is important to recognize how these external factors can provide plenty of power to spur necessary action or change as they are showing how Tobias properly represents someone struggling with identity issues much like that of gender dysphoria.
	While Tobias may not have a mind and body that match, it’s clear that through these various examples Tobias is still able to cope with the situation at hand and work through his issues accordingly. Many of Tobias’ struggles, such as the hunt and his inability to morph directly relate to the challenges that gender dysphoria presents. Tobias’ issues are a battle between animalistic needs and his humanistic wants. Tobias wants to feel normal, to be human, and to just enjoy life. In this sense, Tobias is more than fitting as an ambassador of sorts for gender dysphoria on the basis that Tobias’ problems are more or less gender dysphoria problems. Both issues lead to a yearning to be comfortable with one’s own identity and the relatability of Tobias’ identity struggles provide depth and clarity to an otherwise oppressed group within society that is in need of relatability in literature.
