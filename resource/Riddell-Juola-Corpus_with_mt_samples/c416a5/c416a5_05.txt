	However, this idea that acting out the “ecological Indian” in the Sixth world will provide solutions to problems that wouldn’t have occurred without settler colonialism and the repeated abuse of resources is problematic in that it suggests that the solution was always in the Indigenous people, not in the systematic dismantling of capitalism. There is little done to undo the effects of capitalism, or the fact that the system is still present even though it caused the Big Water. There is also no distinct sense that those who are exploiting Dinétah in the Sixth world are being held accountable for their actions; it appears that there is no desire to get rid of the capitalist structure at all. Maggie and Kai provide a space that allows for the criticism of such systems, but they do not actively seek to undo what is threatening the wellbeing of those living in Dinétah. Rather, the suggestion is that Kai, or someone else with similar clan powers, would be able to restore the environment back to its previous state, thus allowing for capitalism to thrive as the resources being exploited would come back in abundance. And while it would appear that perhaps having a second chance at a healed world in an Indigenous majority community could be possible for Dinétah, the existence of capitalism as a remainder of settler colonialism suggests that there is no escape from that history, even in the Sixth world.
