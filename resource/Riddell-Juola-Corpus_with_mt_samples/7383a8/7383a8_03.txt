The issue I have chosen to research in the natural sciences is Genetically Modified Organisms. This issue is interesting to me because it is a topic that I will like to know more about, and it is an issue that I do not know a lot about. I also am interested in it because genetically modified organisms affect humans directly, negatively and positively. 
How do genetically modified organisms influence genetic diversity? Will it create crossbreeding and uncontrolled growth? Which animals and crops are currently being affected?
