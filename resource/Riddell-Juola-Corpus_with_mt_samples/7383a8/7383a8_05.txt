My hypothesis is that genetically modified plants and crops can crossbreed with natural plants and crops and cause the natural plants to be modified. I can test my hypothesis by bringing different genetically modified plants and having them crossbreed with natural plants to see the effects. For me to find out if a plant is modified I would have to conduct a technique called the polymerase chain reaction. PCR is used to determine the presence of genetically modified sequences. I would check the natural plants DNA by using gel electrophoresis that would pull the DNA through a gel matrix. This separates the different sizes of bands of DNA that correspond to modified and non-modified markers. You can then compare these bands to the genetically modified plants bands. This testing would allow me to see if GMO plants can directly affect a natural plants ability to stay GMO free. This can affect individuals who do not want to consume GMO products, and for companies who label their products as organic, and GMO-free.
A natural scientist could collect this evidence and do this experiment to determine if GMO crops and plants affect natural plants directly. This would allow a natural scientist to determine if the hypothesis will be supported or refuted. I believe that the better evidence and more experiments you can conduct on a hypothesis, allows for a better outcome.
