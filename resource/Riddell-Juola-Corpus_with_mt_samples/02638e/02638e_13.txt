	Atkinson, however, betrays his understanding of Shakespeare’s floating temporality. 

He admits Shakespeare holds a ‘medieval view,’ which pollutes the play regardless of performance -- Shakespeare’s word remains valuable. Atkinson’s point of performance of Shakespeare’s plays, however, does ring true; nearly his entire catalog has enjoyed eclectic casting changes intended to preserve his works and reimagine them to fit more recently derived beliefs. 
	Shakespeare’s historical opinions remain instructive of modern beliefs. However, they also continue to be rather flexible in interpretation. Perhaps, if Shakespeare’s repertoire lacked such prolific acclaim and revolutionary syntax, his famous works would be criticized harsher for what they were: a product of his time. The mixed reactions and regret over Merchant of Venice during the early 20th century represent an artistic crisis in a world dependent on its most esteemed creators. Shakespeare’s symbolic value as a genius incapable of mistakes supersedes his truth -- another writer equally reliant on his times.
