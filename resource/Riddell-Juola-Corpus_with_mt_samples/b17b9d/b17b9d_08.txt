	Winning the lottery will allow me to participate in more activities, but some of the choices I will make would not be much of a difference than the choices I have made without it. I would still major in Psychology and I have taken music classes for the flute. I especially want to travel abroad and I already try to explore many aspects of the university and its environment. With the lottery I would have more freedom to explore my surroundings and not be worried about whether my academics would strongly influence my career and financial stability.
