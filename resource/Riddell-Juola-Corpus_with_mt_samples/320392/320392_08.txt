 	I have researched on multiple organizations to see the roles that their systems analysts play in their companies and they all seem to vary slightly. The first company that I looked into, Deloitte appears to blend their systems analyst between both the user community and the IT staff.  Higher up on the job description is providing support to clients but, if requested, they are also expected to help the IT staff with development if needed.  Another company that, Fidelity, takes a similar approach to Deloitte in that they want the systems analyst to focus on the users first but also provide help within the IT community. For fidelity it seems that they are expected to have more technical skills than Deloitte as the systems analyst is expected to provide install hardware and software components and also understand various programming languages.  The last company that I looked up, Accenture, takes a slightly different approach from both of these companies. Their primary focus appears to be on the IT side of things for the systems analyst. The main focus is for this person to have a strong foundation in programming languages and troubleshooting various IT problems.  They are also expected to work with customers at times but it is not as big of an emphasis as with Deloitte and Fidelity.
	After conducting significant research on the life of a systems analyst it is clear that this job isn’t for everybody. It requires a skillset that takes years to develop and for some people, skills that they may never be able to develop.  It’s a difficult career path but offers a number of potential benefits outside of just a good salary. As a systems analyst you have the ability to work with others on a daily basis and feel as if you’re actually making a difference. Overall, I am interested in this career path and could potentially see myself pursuing it in the future.
