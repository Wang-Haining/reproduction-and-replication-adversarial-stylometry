	The last part of analysis that I performed with our conspiracy data is looking at the occurrences of certain conspiracies. The information here was generally what I expected to see. I felt that most of the conspiracies around Clinton had a lot more emotion, particularly anger/hatred behind them. They went beyond her simply not being fit for President and most to the extent that she belongs in jail. With Trump this was also noticeable but not to the same degree. In terms of the most common conspiracies, with Clinton there seemed to be a strong emphasis on emails, illness, Clinton foundation and Benghazi and with Trump the focus was primarily Russia and sexual misconduct.
	When reflecting upon the work conducted during this project I realize both the understanding of conspiracy that I’ve gained as well as all of the questions that have arose with this understanding. Conspiracy is a concept that is interpreted differently by everyone. A lot of times identifying something as conspiracy is a gut reaction rather than based on concrete evidence or wording. The process of trying to conceptualize this into a binary process and achieve strongly correlated results amongst our team has been a challenging but rewarding process. I look forward to seeing future results as this project is continued.
