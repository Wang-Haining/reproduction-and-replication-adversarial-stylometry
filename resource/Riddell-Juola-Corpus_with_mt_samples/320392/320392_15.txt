A potential solution to this is the introduction of dividual privacy. Dividual privacy, according to Cheney-Lippold is “A privacy that extends beyond our individual bodies, that accepts the realities of ubiquitous surveillance, and that defends the ‘right to be let alone’ even, and especially, when we are made of data…” An advancement in laws protecting our dividual privacy are needed. Even if exact laws aren’t put into place it should be a requirement of each platform to more clearly identify the data that you are giving them access to prior to signing up for their service. Strategically, it is put into the fine print on endless terms & conditions documents and this is unethical towards its users. 
The ever-evolving world of technology has advanced at a rate that even it’s most optimistic supporters couldn’t have predicted 20 years ago. The fact that simple searches for basic information such as “How many calories are in an egg?” gives search engines the ability to intertwine different data and present unique results to each person is unbelievable to me. As the technology industry continues to evolve and better recognize the humanistic side of the ‘individual’ the possibilities within these online platforms is limitless.
