	One final relationship that I have made between this course and my service learning is the importance of paying attention to detail within all aspects of a given task. This class has taught me to analyze a situation from a variety of angles before forming an opinion on the situation. This may sound simple, but it is something that individuals often overlook and is a skill that must be trained. It is also what led me to choose my service learning placement at the Francis House. After initially hearing that the Francis House was an option I thought about my grandmother being there but I still was unsure if it was an environment that I would be comfortable entering. It wasn’t until I looked at it from other perspectives that I felt it was the best option for me. I thought about the impact that I would be making on each of the patients and their families. Yes it is upsetting to think about them dying in front of me but it is also a rewarding feeling to think that I have the ability to make the last few days, weeks, or months of their lives a bit more enjoyable and also provide comfort to their family members. 
	As a student at Syracuse University, I am a privileged individual who has been granted a significant opportunity towards a successful future. Participating in a class that allows me to give back to the community that has provided so much for me is an honor and I am looking forward to it. I hope that with the skills that I have been provided and continue to gain in this class I will be able to have a positive impact on all of the people that I interact with at my placement.
