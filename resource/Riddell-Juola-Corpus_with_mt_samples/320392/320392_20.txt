	After concluding this experiment I would say that it has certainly had an impact on the way that I view my quantified self and the ways that I will go about tracking in the future.  This study pushed me to not just collect data but also ask the questions as to the overall effect of that data. I was no longer reaching for a certain number because that’s what I was told to do online or by a friend, rather I set certain thresholds and tracked the responses that my body gave. I think that as self-tracking becomes more and more popular this is the idea that needs to be understood and followed. Tracking is a great compliment to analyze yourself but should not be used as a stand-alone measure because data without context can do more harm than good.
