The first key point that was relevant to the implementation of an effective MTSS consists of what the leadership structure should look like where RTI is effective.  Whether it is the state level, district level, or school site level. What it “looks like” is directly related to the effectiveness of RTI model.  All members should be “on the same page”.
The key point of importance is the goal is students!  It should be the key motivator whether it is the kids at the lower academic achievement level or the higher end of the achievement level.  When students are the “centerpiece” of the table, and the focus is their instruction, that’s when we know MTSS is working well. 
In places where RTI is working, the leadership structure revolves around “the top and the bottom working together”.  All team members understand the structure: “what it is that we are doing, and why we are doing it”.  It is an approach based on reflection.  Teacher’s collaboration. It is not an expert model. It is a respectful approach.
The importance of a systemic approach to make sure all students get what they need, from special education students, to the highly gifted students.  RTI is an initiative and an innovation that when used with really good leadership can really reach all students.
