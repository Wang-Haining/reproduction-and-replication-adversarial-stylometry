For all magnificent life which existed in the art of the Renaissance, little more than its archeological existence can be seen today. These classic artworks are no longer able to call up deep emotion in us, they already belong to a world of the past. Novel beauty found in works of art and architecture of the past have changed appearance due to the beauty of decay. This is the beauty of the material when it is free’d from artificial makeup and reveals its original characteristics. It is a sign of the material taking revenge and recapturing its original life. 
Jiro Yoshihara went on to state that purely formalistic abstracts had lost their charm.

The energy implicit in an area of paint is defined in terms of the time which it takes for the eye to journey through the implicit motion and direction of the area.

The fundamental life of any material used by Carolee is concretized in that materials gesture.
