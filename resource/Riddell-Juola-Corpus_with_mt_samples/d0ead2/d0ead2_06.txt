Trends come and go with each passing decade. The thing that separates tattoo trends from other trends of the past is the permanence of tattoos. If tattoos were temporary, the terrible trends of the nineties would be all but forgotten, but since tattoos are permanent it’s not uncommon to see a full tribal sleeve while spending time on the beach. While tattooing as an art form is always evolving and growing, this form of art is not immune from trendy imagery and poor design compositions. Originality can be hard to come by when everyone is seeking a similar design, but accomplished tattoo artists will always try to put their own twist on a design.
